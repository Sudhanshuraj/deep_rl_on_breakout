We have attached the reults obtained in the output folder and code used to generate the results have also been attached.
We have attached two code folder: 
[1] atari-ddqn: It implements the DDQN algorithm with 2D feature matrix. Details explained in the report.
[2] atari-a3c: It implements the a3c algorithm with 1D feature vector and details of implementation is in report.

For baseline models, links have been provided in the "References" section of the report.
Download it from there to run it.
